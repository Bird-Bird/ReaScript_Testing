# ReaScript
This repository hosts scripts that I have created for the DAW REAPER.

You can find the forum post for these scripts here: https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=266975

All of the scripts here can be installed through the [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) extension for REAPER. It is also recommended to install [js_ReaScriptAPI](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=212174), [SWS](https://www.sws-extension.org/), and [ReaImGui](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=250419) extensions as there are various scripts that require them. It is a good idea to install these extensions in general as a lot of community created scripts require them as a dependency.

You can also find the license for the scripts in this repository [here](https://github.com/Bird-Bird/ReaScript_Testing/blob/main/LICENSE).
